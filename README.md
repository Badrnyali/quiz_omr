This repository is a quiz of four steps.
The data are just mockup data.
The logo was borrowed from the main website.
I used plain HTML,CSS & Vanilla JS.
I used a lot of AI, since it was seen as good thing, and exactly used cursor AI to code.
This projects is using vite, so ```npm install```and ```npm run dev```and you're good to go.
